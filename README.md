# PYTDL
Yet another YouTube video downloader made with python

### <mark>IMPORTANT NOTE</mark>:
THIS FILE CAN  AND PROBABLY <mark>WILL GET FLAGGED</mark> AS VIRUS BY ANTIVIRUSES BECAUSE IT ISN'T SIGNED (I'm just too poor to).
If you want to download it **you can manually allow it** in your software but <mark>**DO NOT** deactivate your antivirus</mark> only to download this program. (It's just a YT downloader. It's not worth exposing the whole system)

## Installation

To correctly install the file you will have to <mark>follow these **three easy steps**</mark>:

1. Download from the latest release "PYTDL-main.exe"
3. Save the zipped file you just downloaded in your preferred folder and unzip it: The app is called "PYTD-main.exe"

    (Next steps are only necessary if the Antivirus flags this as malicious software)
  
4. - After you downloaded the file, if there is a popup from the Antivirus asking for an action for the supposed "threat" allow the file you just downloaded 
   - If there is no popup OR after doing the previous step you can't find the file or it won't run navigate n your Anti virus software towards exceptions/exclusions and make sure to allow both file type "PYDL-main.exe" and process "PYDL-main.exe"

## Qualities

Pros: 
- Very good for downloading videos as Mp3.
- Absolutely ZERO bloatware.
- (Obv) Data is processed EXCLUSIVELY on user's device.

Cons:
- Videos (expecially if high res) are slow to download due to the fact that the machine has to download audio, video, and render them out
